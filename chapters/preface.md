This book is a companion book to the Go Bootcamp event organized for the
first time in Santa Monica CA in March 2014.

You don't need to install Go to read this book and follow along. This book was designed
to delay the setup process and let you evaluate Go without having to go through the
installation process. All examples and solutions are available online in an environment
allowing you to execute code right in the browser.
