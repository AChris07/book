#Methods and interfaces
\label{cha:methods_and_interfaces}

While technically Go isn't an [Object Oriented Programming
language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming),
types and methods allow for an object-oriented style of programming.
The big difference is that Go does not support type inheritance but
instead has a concept of interface.

In this chapter, we will focus on Go's use of methods and interfaces.

## Methods
\label{sec:methods}

*Note*: A frequently asked question is "what is the difference between
a function and a method". A method is a function that has a defined
receiver, in OOP terms, a method is a function on an instance of an
object.
